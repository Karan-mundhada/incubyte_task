# Library Management System

## Project Overview
This is a **Library Management System** implemented in Python. The system allows users to perform basic operations like adding, borrowing, returning, and viewing books available in a library. It is designed with clean, maintainable code and follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

### Features
1. **Add Books**: 
   - Users can add new books to the library. 
   - Each book has a unique ISBN, title, author, and publication year.

2. **Borrow Books**: 
   - Users can borrow a book from the library. 
   - The system checks if the book is available before borrowing.

3. **Return Books**: 
   - Users can return a borrowed book, and the system updates the availability status.

4. **Remove Books**: 
   - Users can remove a book if it is available and not currently borrowed.

5. **View Available Books**: 
   - Users can view all the books that are currently available in the library.

6. **Search Books**: 
   - Users can search for books by title or author.
